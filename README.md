Hemispheres is a browser-based puzzle game designed to act as a neurological handshake. Unlike standard crosswords or logic puzzles which tax only one specific cognitive mode, Hemispheres forces you to use both simultaneously.

The screen is split into two distinct halves:

The Left Hemisphere (Creative): Presents an abstract, poetic riddle or "vibe."

The Right Hemisphere (Logical): Presents a rigid constraint, pattern, or mathematical formula.

The Synapse: Your goal is to find the single word that satisfies both sides perfectly.
