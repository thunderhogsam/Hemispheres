🧠 Hemispheres

A daily game of synthesis.
Connect your creative and analytical sides.

🧐 What is Hemispheres?

Hemispheres is a browser-based puzzle game designed to act as a neurological handshake. Unlike standard crosswords or logic puzzles which tax only one specific cognitive mode, Hemispheres forces you to use both simultaneously.

The screen is split into two distinct halves:

The Left Hemisphere (Creative): Presents an abstract, poetic riddle or "vibe."

The Right Hemisphere (Logical): Presents a rigid constraint, pattern, or mathematical formula.

The Synapse: Your goal is to find the single word that satisfies both sides perfectly.

🎮 How to Play

Read the Creative Clue on the left (e.g., "I run but have no legs").

Analyze the Logical Pattern on the right (e.g., "7 Letters, Ends in T").

Type your answer into the center input field.

If correct, the synapse connects. If wrong, the system rejects the input.

🤖 The "Vibe Coding" Philosophy

This game was developed using Cursor and AI-assisted "Vibe Coding." The goal was to focus purely on the user experience and aesthetic ("the vibe") while allowing AI to handle the syntax and implementation. It stands as an experiment in rapid, natural-language software development.
